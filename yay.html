        My love, I can't express enough how much you mean to me. From the moment
        I first saw you on New Year's Eve, I fell for you instantly. I never
        expected you to come into my life so suddenly, but you changed
        everything for me. Even when I get lost in my thoughts, you’re always
        there by my side. I feel incredibly lucky to have met you. I don’t know
        what the future holds, but I promise to care for you and our
        relationship always. You are everything to me, and I truly want this
        love to last♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ I love you soooo much Megan! ♡♡♡♡
