        My love, I can't express enough how much you mean to me. From the moment I first saw you on New Year's Eve, I fell for you instantly. I never expected you to come into my life so suddenly, but you changed everything for me in the most beautiful way. Even when I get lost in my thoughts or feel overwhelmed by life, you are always there by my side, grounding me and making me feel safe. I feel incredibly lucky to have met you, and I cherish every moment we share. No matter what difficulties we encounter, I know we will face them together. Thank you for coming into my life and showing me that I can do anything for someone I love. I promise to save money so we can travel to Japan together, I want to share those experiences with you. To be fair I don’t know what the future holds, but I promise to care for you and our relationship. You are everything to me, and I truly want this love to last forever. I love you sooooooooooooooooooooooo much Megan ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
